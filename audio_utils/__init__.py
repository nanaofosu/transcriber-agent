"""Utility functions for processing and normalising audio.

This package contains helpers built on top of ffmpeg for converting
userâ€‘supplied recordings into a format suitable for downstream transcription
models.  Functions here should not perform any transcription themselves but
may downsample, change channel count, strip metadata or perform other
preprocessing tasks.
